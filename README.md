Prompt:

"Write a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to do the following in Google Colab:
Allow the user to upload any colored image.
Convert the image to grayscale and then to a binary image using Otsu's thresholding.
Apply Connected Component labeling to detect and count all objects in the binary image.
Display the total number of objects detected.
Create a colorful visualization of the connected components (each object in a different random color).
Display the Original Image, Binary Image, and Connected Component Labeled Image using Matplotlib in a clear layout with proper titles and axes turned off.
Ensure the code is fully compatible with Google Colab and runs without errors."
